Contrastive Learning for Label Noise Recognition

## Introduction
Contrastive learning has been pushing the benchmarks for representation learning without the use of (reliable) labels. 
This project will leverage the power of these approaches to automatically flag instances in time-series dataset that
are the most likely to be mislabeled.
